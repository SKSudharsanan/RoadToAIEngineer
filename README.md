# Road to AI Engineer

## Overview
Welcome to my documentation of a personal journey to rebuild my confidence as a developer and transform into an AI engineer. After 6+ years as a software engineer in the blockchain space, I faced setbacks but now I’m ready to take on a new challenge.

## Background
- **Experience:** 6+ years in software engineering with a focus on blockchain. My last role was as a Rust engineer working on APIs using Actix Web.
- **Machine Learning Experience:** Worked on various ML tasks including:
  - Face recognition
  - Consumer-facing chatbots
  - Predictive algorithms

- **Entrepreneurial Attempt:** Tried to build a decentralized AI company. The idea was to create decentralized AI agents using Llama.cpp as edge nodes and build a decentralized network. Unfortunately, I couldn’t go past the MVP stage.

- **Consulting:** Transitioned to consulting work with the help of a previous founder. Currently involved in content management.

## Current Challenge
While I'm content with my current role, I’ve faced significant struggles in maintaining my confidence as a developer. I haven't been hands-on with coding for several months and feel disconnected from my core skills.

## New Focus
AI and decentralization have always been my interests. I'm embarking on a journey to:
1. Rebuild my coding skills.
2. Learn advanced AI techniques.
3. Document every step of my transformation into an AI expert.

## Goals
- Regain confidence in software development.
- Achieve proficiency in AI engineering.
- Share insights, challenges, and progress.

## This Repository
This repo will serve as a comprehensive record of my journey. I'll be updating it regularly with:
- Coding exercises
- Projects and challenges
- Lessons learned
- Roadblocks and how I overcame them

Follow along as I rebuild my developer mindset and push towards becoming an AI engineer.
