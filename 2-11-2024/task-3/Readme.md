## Use Case: Predicting House Prices

## Task 3: Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing

###	1.	Dataset Preparation
Download a housing dataset, such as the well-known Ames Housing dataset. Load it into a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring there’s no data corruption.
###	2.	Feature Engineering
	•	Creating New Features: Based on existing columns, create features that might be useful predictors. For example:
	•	Calculate total square footage by combining columns like basement and ground floor area.
	•	Create age of house as the difference between the year sold and year built.
	•	Generate binary indicators for features like the presence of a pool, garage, or fireplace.
	•	Categorical Encoding: For categorical variables like neighborhood or house style, use one-hot encoding or label encoding where appropriate.
	•	Log Transformations: For skewed numerical features, apply log transformation to reduce skewness (e.g., log-transforming square footage or price).
###	3.	Handling Missing Values
	•	Impute missing values with appropriate strategies:
	•	For numerical features, you could use the median or mean.
	•	For categorical features, consider filling with the most frequent category or a new category like “Unknown.”
	4.	Scaling and Normalization
	•	Scale numerical features using a technique like Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling to prepare for machine learning. (Standard scaling is usually better for regression models like linear regression, while tree-based models may not need it.)

## Deliverable

	•	Upload your cleaned and transformed dataset as a CSV file on GitHub.
	•	Share your Jupyter Notebook (or Python script) with the full feature engineering and preprocessing steps, including comments explaining your choices.
