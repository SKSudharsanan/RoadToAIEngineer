# Road to AI Engineer

It is 25-10-2024.

Now, exactly at 2:07 PM, I am starting my journey.

The first step I’m taking is to enroll in a course at [DeepLearning.AI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-python-for-beginners/lesson/1/introduction).

### Why DeepLearning.AI?

I’ve always heard that AI engineers start off with Andrew Ng, even before generative AI became a thing. So, I’ve decided to take this short course on **AI Python for Beginners: Basics of AI Python Coding.**

I have no idea if this is the right choice, but I’ll put down my review here once I’m done.

### Progress Updates:

- **25-10-2024, 2:25 PM:** Just completed watching the introduction video.

  **My thoughts:** This course is structured to work alongside an LLM, definitely not what I was expecting. I was hoping for core Python, basic NLP, numpy, and more hands-on programming.

  Despite this, I’ve decided to complete it to get a full grasp. Let’s see where it goes.
