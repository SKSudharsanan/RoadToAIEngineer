I was down for a week because of a viral fever and couldn't do anything. I am still not 100% recovered but have started learning again.

One thing I really loved about Andrew Ng's basic Python course is the use of ChatGPT as an assistant. Inspired by this, I decided to create my own GPT called Sam to assist me in this journey.

The purpose of Sam is to streamline my tasks and guide me step-by-step from scratch to becoming an AI engineer. Once I gain complete confidence, I will be open-sourcing Sam so that it can become everyone's tutor in becoming an AI engineer.
